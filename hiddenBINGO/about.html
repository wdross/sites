      <p>Thanks to:	  Buzzword Bingo Game bigger and better:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Concept
          <ul>
            <li>Instigated by a customer and my son, I wanted to have an interactive bingo card
                that could be played by multiple people with phrases said by our favorite Project
                Manager.</li>
            <li>I came across <a href="https://www.bullshitbingo.net/">the Original Bullshit bingo game</a> for which I really liked the layout and
                interaction, BUT I wanted a system for which I didn't need to maintain the phrases.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>	
        <li>Original game:

            <li>Frank Ledo: Original author, <a href="https://www.bullshitbingo.net/about/">see his full writeup on his page.</a>
	    <li>Jared Bienz: Suggested the ability to mark phrases off in a 
	      web browser using CSS and Java Script.</li>
	  </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
