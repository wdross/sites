<p style="text-align:left;">I recently participated in LSSU's Women In Technology Camp in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. This program was an outstanding mix of having fun with other girls and learning about robotics, electronics, computer animation, Computer Aided Design, material handling, and web page design. In fact, I created this web page with the guidance of one of the program's amazing teachers. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank the Petoskey Education Foundation for providing me with a $500 scholarship to attend this amazing camp. I would also like to offer a big thanks to my grandmother who has decided to reimburse my parents for the rest of the fee that wasn't covered by the foundation's generous scholarship. And, of course, I need to say thanks to my parents for supporting me through my entire school career and allowing me to participate in this particular program. So, I hope everyone reading this enjoys a look at what happened at this awesome camp!</p> 

<p style="text-align:left;">I have been having so much fun at LSSU's Women In Technology Camp! This
week has been filled with programming robots, designing parts with CAD on the
computer, making computer animations, and constructing a radio. I love working
with the robots and I just finished my presentation for the last day. I also
enjoyed working with CAD a lot, but I'm not sure the feeling was mutual. The
program refused to do anything the right way, but I had a lot of help and the
program seems like it could be used to do a lot of interesting stuff. Computer
animation gave me even more trouble, but the results were pretty entertaining!
The radio. I got to solder lots of little wires and electronic pieces together
to create a working AM radio. I was amazed that it actually did end up working
for me. I have loved this camp and I'm so sad that it has to end!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">At this camp, we also have had a ton of fun doing
activities in the evenings. We watched Hairspray on a big screen in one of the
empty classrooms. We got to go ice-skating at Chi Mukwa, which was very
traumatic for me. Our group also visited the Student Athletic Center and had
fun playing with all the equipment, and then we got to go swimming and diving!
Yesterday, we went down to Mackinaw City and played around at Thunder Falls for
the afternoon. After that exhausting day, we went to Applebee's and heard two
women engineers discussing their profession. When we were in town, all 16 of us
went mini-golfing (with TONS of misquites), afterwhich we went to the closest
ice cream shop. Every night was filled with tons of fun with my new friends!</p>
